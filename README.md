# Tea#
We like tea. We have decided to write a program involving tea.

functionality of this project (possible ideas):
1. the great tea catalogue of teas we've had, complete with a search and our preferences of how we like them
2. our Tea suggestions taking into consideration how the user is feeling 
3. am I consuming too much caffiene?
4. tea features (sugar, temperature, toppings)
5. tea rankings
6. a tea robot....without the actual robot because that costs money
7. a tea map of the world and its delicious teas
8. a tea "profile" in case multiple people use the program this could be used to make tea suggestions through machine learning (e.g. people with a similar tea profile gave a certain tea a very high rating)
